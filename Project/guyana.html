  <p>The Republic of Guyana lies in the north-east of South America, north of the equator. It is bordered by Suriname on the east, Brazil on the south and Venezuela on the west, and to the north and east, extends to the North Atlantic Ocean. </p>

<p>The coastal plain, along which the majority of the population lives, is flat but the country is famous for its mountain ranges, lush forests, vast savannahs and above all the majestic Kaieteur Falls with an overall drop of 251 metres and a sheer drop of 226 metres. It is richly endowed with natural resources, extensive areas of fertile agricultural land, vast stretches of tropical hardwood forests most of which are still untouched, a rich fishing and shrimping continental shelf, a wide variety of minerals (including gold, diamond and some semi-precious stones, bauxite and manganese) impressive resources for hydropower generation and potential for petroleum. </p>

<h3>Vegetation</h3>
<p>Guyana's tropical rain forest, covering 86% of the land area, is among the most ecologically valuable and best preserved in the world. The environment is an issue of great importance for Guyana.</p>
<br/><br/>

<div class="right">
<p>Forestry development activities are expanding at a fast rate due to the country's huge potential and the availability of a wide variety of precious woods which are in high demand in the overseas market. The government is committed to a responsible and sustainable development of its forestry resources through astute management. Guyana is a member of the Treaty of Amazonian Cooperation which encourages the subscribers to carry out a rational exploitation of the Region in co-ordination with the other seven South American countries. Moreover, Guyana took a lead role at the Earth Summit on Environment held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in June 1991, and endorsed the need to promote the process of sustainable development. </p>
