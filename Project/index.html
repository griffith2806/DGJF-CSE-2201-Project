    Welcome to Guyana
  </h1>
  <p>
Come experience the very peak of all-inclusive vacations in South America. Welcome to Guyana… to our ultimate luxury Resort – Splashmins.
We offer to the world a potpourri of Caribbean cultures, a taste of South American Tradition with a blast of nature.

Splashmins nestled in the heart of the Madewini wetlands on the Linden Soesdyke Highway is a mere 45 minutes drive from the Capital City and 15 minutes from the Cheddi Jagan International Airport.

Our Resort features a Water Park with loads of fun activities such as peddle boats, jet boat, facilities for cricket, football and basketball and a 1/4 mile long man made sand beach which is washed by a mystical black water lake.

Indulge yourself in an overnight stay at our luxurious Hotel. These extravagant villas are all self contained and was designed to provide refined comfort in a tranquil environment.
If however you are the more serene type then join us on the nature side at our Eco adventure park and camping grounds. Enjoy relaxing in hammocks tied between any of our fruit trees or camping out while you cook or BBQ outdoors.

Splashmins Resort also offers the perfect scenery for wedding and corporate events.
Living the dream is now a reality with the introduction of our Resort living community. We offer retired homes for persons who really would love to live the rest of their lives on vacation. Also we offer corporate villas and lake front housing for persons of any age group.

We invite you to enjoy and experience nature, adventure and living in a style too elaborate to describe.
